    <p>Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. We'll make some happy little bushes here.
            Just
            let these leaves jump off the brush No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen.</p>
    <p>Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. When things happen - enjoy
            them.
            They're little gifts. Mountains are so simple, they're hard. We don't have to be committed. We are just
            playing
            here. Just relax and let it flow. That easy.</p>
    <p>Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things There we go. Put
            light
            against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and
            dark
            that each give the other one meaning.</p>
